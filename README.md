# leaflet-challenge

This project visualizes earthquake data over the last week using the Leaflet library. Part 1 just shows 
earthquake data. Part 2 shows earthquake and tectonic plate data. Both are interactive 
maps that utilize JSON data from the US Geological Survey and tectonic plate data pulled 
from fraxen on GitHub.

You may need to run a local server to get part 2 to work.
- Open the terminal
- Navigate to project directory for part 2
- Run 'python -m http.server'
- - By default, this starts a server on port 8000
- Using the browser, go to 'http://localhost:8000/index.html'

Earthquake Data: US Geological Survey (USGS) Earthquake Data Feed
Tectonic Plate Boundaries: PB2002_plates.json on GitHub
